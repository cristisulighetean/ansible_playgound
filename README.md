# Ansible for DevOps Practice Examples

This repository contains my practice examples while going through the book [Ansible for DevOps](https://www.ansiblefordevops.com/) by Jeff Geerling. The examples cover various topics in the book and represent my progress and understanding of the subject.

## About The Book

[Ansible for DevOps](https://www.ansiblefordevops.com/) is a book written by Jeff Geerling. The book is a guide to using Ansible for infrastructure automation. It is designed to be a comprehensive source for learning Ansible for configuration management and orchestration.

## Prerequisites

To run these examples, you will need:

Ansible
Vagrant
VirtualBox / QEMU (or any other provider supported by Vagrant)
Please ensure you have these installed and properly configured.

## Running the Examples

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/cristiansulighetean/ansible-for-devops-examples.git
2. Navigate into the directory of the example you want to run.
3. Follow the instructions in the README of each example (if available).

Generally, for Vagrant-based examples, you can simply run vagrant up to start the VMs and execute the Ansible playbooks.
